# Multi instance test runner

## Description

The Multi instance test runner launches and runs multiple instances
of a specific test on multiple nodes.
The multi instance test runner is provided a config file and description
file during execution.

## Config file

The config file for multi instance is similar to the original config file
used for test runner. The key 'test_mode' set to "littleChief" instructs the
test runner to run in multi instance mode.
The config file also details the list of nodes on which the tests will run.

## Sample config file
multiconfigfile

{
"host_list": ["wolf-24", "wolf-27"],
"test_mode": "littleChief",
"use_daemon":"DvmRunner"
}

## Description file

The description file is a yaml formatted file, which contains sections
detailing the attributes required for the execution, arranged as
key-value pairs. At the top level the sections are: description, module,
directives, use_daemon and execStrategy.
The 'description' section provides a short description of the file.
The 'module' section provides the information on the infrastructure set up
for the test.
The 'directives' section set certain environment variables for the test run.
The 'use_daemon' section lists the deamons to be run in the background.
The behaviour of the test run is influenced by the 'execStrategy' section. This
section contains a list of Test Description files that are executed using Test
Runner.
Under 'module' the 'hostConfig' key specifies the number of IO nodes and
compute nodes to be used. The type (ION/CN) are attributed to specific nodes
listed in the configuration file.
The test/iof_multi_instance.yml file can be regarded as a sample description
file for future multi instance tests.

## Execution

The multi instance test runner launches the test on the nodes, Compute or
IO as specified by the key 'nodeType' in the 'execStrategy' entry. The tests
can contain a setup and cleanup which are sepcified by the 'type' in the
entry. This will set an environment variable that can be used to include or
exclude test cases. All entries will be executed as individual test files
in the order described in the 'execStrategy'.

To launch the test manually:
python3 test_runner config=multiconfigfile scripts/iof_multi_instance.yml
